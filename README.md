# ways-of-visualize-datasets-in-univariate-bivariate-and-multi-variate-classes
This repository show how to realize data based on EDA and vizualization analysis to perform descriptive analysis and understand data

Before any data mining or other related works we should make data clean to increase the decision making accuracy and validation based on clear data.
Best preprocesing come with best understanding of data. Fortunately, statistics helps us in each steps in this concept. For preprocess and understanding datasets we can perform descriptive analysis. Other analysis in univariate, bivariate, multivariate, EDA and visualizations helps us to realise data and it's scopes.
I use the real world dataset in car dealing market to perfom my python codes on It. and I called it car price (2). csv.
this section I upload codes of understanding and preprocessing datasets and after that I upload machine learning and datamining codes of predicting best price offer for each class.

### Please read the 'About the data.txt' file.

you can see the preproccessing results in 'somhow preproccessed data.csv'. the preproccessing procedure didn't complete and it will be update in future tasks.
